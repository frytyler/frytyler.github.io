              <br />I am a full stack developer from Ottawa Canada. Here youâ€™ll
              find a few things about me, my{' '}

              <Anchor href="#key-practices">Key Practices</Anchor> and my{' '}
              <Anchor href="#experience">Experience</Anchor>. I often find that
              people present their experiences first, however I believe that
              core values and key practices are what have enabled me to do great
              work.
