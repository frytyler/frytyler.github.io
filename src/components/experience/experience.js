              A large portion of my role at MB3 is a Team Lead. In that position
              I help the two development teams by providing context, direction
              and support. This is done through a variety of ways including
              mentorship and training. <br />
              <br />
              My remaining time is spent as a senior fullstack developer. Our
              current legacy product is built in Coldfusion + MsSQL and jQuery
              frontend. We have been working on multiple solutions to modernize
              this through Node.js, MySQL, Mongo, RxJS in the backend and the
              full React ecosystem in the frontend.

              CRG provides all the resources to the Conservative Members of
              Parliament. Our team was providing a variety of services both to
              internal staff as well as MPâ€™s. We built a platform to provide
              each MP with a unique website that they could control. The
              platform provided a library of plugins targeted to their market.
              <br />
              <br />
              Through building that platform and a number of other services, I
              was able to learn very valuable skills that I continue to use
              everyday. <br />
              <br />
              The stack consisted of PHP, MySQL, Javascript, Backbone and
              others.
